## Hello Reviewers!

- I misunderstood the direction about "not creating entries manually" for phase1. As the implementation is correct for phase2, I did not go back to correct this.
- From years of math coursework, I find working with (x,y) coordinates more intuitive than row=0, colum=1. I relied on this intuitive understanding to make sure my mapping functions work as intended via unit tests. This requires mapping from row-colum space to (x,y) space and back to row-column space in the code, but it makes the unit tests more intuitive.
